ENCRYPTED PDF FIXTURE

This directory should contain encrypted.pdf for testing password handling.

To generate encrypted.pdf:

Method 1 (qpdf - recommended):
  qpdf --encrypt test123 "" 40 -- simple.pdf encrypted.pdf

Method 2 (Python + PyPDF2):
  pip install PyPDF2
  python3 << 'PYTHON'
from PyPDF2 import PdfWriter, PdfReader
reader = PdfReader("simple.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()
for page in reader.pages:
    writer.add_page(page)
writer.encrypt(user_password="test123", owner_password="", algorithm="RC4-40")
with open("encrypted.pdf", "wb") as f:
    writer.write(f)
PYTHON

Method 3 (Manual - for CI/CD):
  Download pre-encrypted test PDF from:
  https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/test/pdfs
  
Password: test123

For now, the runner will skip encrypted tests if file doesn't exist.
